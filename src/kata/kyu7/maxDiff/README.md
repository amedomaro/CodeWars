# max diff - easy
You must implement a function `maxDiff` that return the difference between the biggest and the smallest value in a 
list(`lst`) received as parameter.

The list(`lst`) contains integers, that means it may contain some negative numbers.

If the list is empty or contains a single element, `return 0`.
~~~~
maxDiff([1, 2, 3, 4]); //return 3, because 4 - 1 == 3
maxDiff([1, 2, 3, -4]); //return 7, because 3 - (-4) == 7
~~~~
Have fun!
